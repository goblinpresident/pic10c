Project: A virtual pet game

My goal is to make a virtual pet game. Things you can do in the game would be feed, clean, play with, 
and match-make the pet if time permits. Matchmaking the pet would consist of accepting or declining mates for your pet as they come. 
The mates will have different traits and when a match is accepted, a new generation pet will replace 
the original pet, with a mix of traits from both mates.
It would be a console app with ASCII art to display the virtual pet.
